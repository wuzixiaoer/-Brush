A fantastic image compositing from Group 21 in DeeCamp.

We enable one to copy an object in a photo and paste it into a painting so that the composite still looks like a genuine painting in the style of the original painting.

It mainly includes two sub-modules:
- Object Segemntation
- Style Transfer
